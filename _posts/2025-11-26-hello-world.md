Hey. Welcome.

This is my little island on the internet. 🏝️

You'll notice there're already some posts here. I copied them from my linkedin account because I want them somewhere that actually makes sense [^1]. 

### why

I want a place to dump my thoughts, share experiences, and maybe get feedback from people who actually care. 

I also want to force myself to write about what I find interesting. Too often ideas die in my head because I don't have a platform where I can shape them into something readable.

### content

Short. Spartan. No fluff. I hate buzzwordy consulting nonsense, and you will not find it here.

Everything I write is my view. It doesn't represent my employer or anyone else.

### design

I'm using [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please). Ugly? Yes. But it works. No CSS bloat, no distractions. This page will probably still render fine in 2074, whether you're on a browser or a brain implant.

### inspiration

Some people's sites that I like, both for content and aesthetics:

* [elly.town](https://elly.town/)
* [matmul.net](https://matmul.net/)
* [geohot.com](https://geohot.com/)
* [noperator.dev](https://noperator.dev/)

### privacy

I use [GoatCounter](https://goatcounter.com/). Open source. Tracks visits without cookies. No personal data. No GDPR headaches. Just simple numbers, that's it.

### see you around

That's it for now. More posts to come. Or connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mllamazares/) if that's your vibe.

[^1]: Linkedin is fine for some things, but it's not for thinking out loud. :)
