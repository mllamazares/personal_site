Hey there. Welcome.

My name's [Miguel](/about.html) and this is my little island on the Internet. 🏝️

You'll notice there're already some posts here. I stole them from my own [linkedin account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mllamazares/) because I want them somewhere that actually makes sense. Linkedin is fine for some things, but it's not for thinking out loud. 

### why

I want a place to dump my thoughts, share experiences, and maybe get feedback from people who actually care. 

I also want to force myself to write about what I find interesting. Too often ideas die in my head because I don't have a platform where I can shape them into something readable.

### content

Expect something short and straight to the point. I hate buzzwordy consulting nonsense, and you will not find it here.

I consider myself _anti-SEO_. I hate posts stuffed with the same keywords like a malfunctioning churn machine, rambling forever with AI slop just to maximize screen time, only to spring some _surprise_ pitch at the end. No thanks. Then you hit paywalls, cookie walls, bloated layouts, and other mythological creatures. In my opinion, they've made the Internet a worse place to explore.

Lastly, everything I write is my view. It doesn't represent my employer or anyone else.

### design

I'm using the [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) Jekyll theme with the iconic [Geist Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Geist+Mono) font. Ugly? Yes. But it works. No CSS bloat, no distractions. 

You can laugh all you want, but I bet this page will probably still render fine in 2074, whether you're using a browser or a brain implant.

### inspiration

Some people's sites that I like, both for content and aesthetics:

  - [elly.town](https://elly.town/)
  - [matmul.net](https://matmul.net/)
  - [geohot.com](https://geohot.com/)
  - [ian.sh](https://ian.sh/)
  - [noperator.dev](https://noperator.dev/)
  - [ben.page](https://ben.page/)
  - [arp242.net](https://arp242.net/)
  - [sophiebits.com](https://sophiebits.com/)
  - [hux.site](https://hux.site/)

### privacy

I just use [GoatCounter](https://goatcounter.com/). Open source. Tracks visits _without_ cookies. No personal data. No GDPR headaches. Just to get a rough sense of the traffic; I'm not a stalker. 🤞

### see you around

That's it for now. More posts to come. Or connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mllamazares/) if that's your vibe.
