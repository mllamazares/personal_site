Hey there. Welcome.

I'm [Miguel](/about.html) and this is my little island on the internet. 🏝️

You'll notice there're already some posts here. I stole them from my own [linkedin account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mllamazares/) because I want them somewhere that actually makes sense. Linkedin is fine for some things, but it's not for thinking out loud. 

### why

I want a place to dump my thoughts, share experiences, and maybe get feedback from people who actually care. 

I also want to force myself to write about what I find interesting. Too often ideas die in my head because I don't have a platform where I can shape them into something readable.

### content

Expect something short and straight to the point. I hate buzzwordy consulting nonsense, and you will not find it here.

I consider myself _anti-SEO_. I hate posts stuffed with the same keywords like a bad spam bot, rambling forever with AI slop just to maximize screen time, only to spring some surprise pitch at the end. No thanks. Then you hit paywalls, cookie walls, bloated layouts, and other mythological creatures. In my opinion, they've made the internet a worse place to explore.

Lastly, everything I write is my view. It doesn't represent my employer or anyone else.

### design

I'm using [no-style-please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) with the iconic [Cascadia Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cascadia+Code) font. Ugly? Yes. But it works. No CSS bloat, no distractions. 

You can laugh all you want, but I bet this page will probably still render fine in 2074, whether you're on a browser or a brain implant.

### inspiration

Some people's sites that I like, both for content and aesthetics:

  - [elly.town](https://elly.town/)
  - [matmul.net](https://matmul.net/)
  - [geohot.com](https://geohot.com/)
  - [ian.sh](https://ian.sh/)
  - [noperator.dev](https://noperator.dev/)

### privacy

I just use [GoatCounter](https://goatcounter.com/). Open source. Tracks visits _without_ cookies. No personal data. No GDPR headaches. Just to get a rough sense of the traffic; I'm not a stalker. 🤞

### see you around

That's it for now. More posts to come. Or connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mllamazares/) if that's your vibe.
