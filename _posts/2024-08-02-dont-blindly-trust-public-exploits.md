Found this shady function in a GitHub PoC for a CVE:

![shady PoC function](/assets/img/shady-function.png)

It looks like, in exchange for a shortcut to exploit it, you help the author build a database of vulnerable endpoints cataloged by CVE number, IP, and port (it only makes the request if the target is confirmed vulnerable). 

I checked the reputation of that domain in VirusTotal, and it's flagged as "Malware" by Fortinet. 

That's why it's crucial to always review the exploits before blindly firing them off, guys.
