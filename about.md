Hey, I'm Miguel Llamazares (_/miˈɣel ʎamaˈθaɾes/_[^1]) an Offensive Security Manager working remotely from the green edge of northern Spain. ⛰️🐄

I'm obsessed with appsec, web pentesting, and the growing role of AI in hacking. That's why [I started this blog](/hello-world), which currently has {% include total_word_count.html %} words.
