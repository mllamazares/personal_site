Oops, I can't find the page you're looking for. 🛸

You can try again by heading [back to the homepage]({{ "/" | relative_url }}).

To make this a little less embarrassing, I've asked an LLM to generate a haiku for you:

> Lost page, missing bits <br>The void stares back at your hopes<br>Refresh won't save this

<br>
Hope it feels better now. Stay safe. 🫂

    if (window.location.pathname.endsWith('.html')) {
        var newUrl = window.location.pathname.replace(/\.html$/, '');
        window.location.replace(newUrl);
    }
</script>
